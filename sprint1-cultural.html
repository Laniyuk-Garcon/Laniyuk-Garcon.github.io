<p class="question-culture">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made 
    and the consequences of the action you took</p>


<p>As a writer and a poet I perform almost weekly as a one of my main forms of income. A 
    little over a year ago I realized that most of the venues I was performing in weren’t
     wheelchair accessible. Accessibility (physical, intellectual, financial etc) is something 
     I value a prioritise. I couldn’t continue to perform in spaces that were literally built
      to exclude a demographic of people, whether that was intentional or not. I also didn’t 
      want to continue participating in artist spaces that didn’t consider the accessibility 
      needs of the Disabled community. I felt it was my responsibility as an able-bodied person 
      to take a stand so I publicly announced I would no longer be accepting gigs that weren’t
       wheelchair accessible and didn’t have accessible toilets.</p>

<p>I think it’s one thing to tell yourself you’ll commit to something but when you pledge that to a 
     community of people, who watch and hold you to account, it’s a different type of pressure. To tell 
     friends of mine that are wheelchair users that I no longer perform in inaccessible venues puts a lot
   of emotional pressure to maintain that pledge. It holds me to account.
    It surprisingly hasn’t impacted a lot of my financial gain from performances but the events I’ve had 
    to turn down have been ‘grassroots’ events. It’s been sad to turn down political and community led events 
   because they’ve lacked the funding to rent out a space that is accessible.</p>

 <p class="question-culture">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</p>
 <p>Land protection is at the forefront of my values and identity. Being that my lands are currently being 
occupied by a white-supremacist colonial nation state that has strategically enacted propaganda led genocide, my 
values and identity is resistant based. My priority is working toward the return of Aboriginal Land into 
the hands and control of Aboriginal people.</p>

<p class="question-culture">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <ls>I’m not well versed in tech language or basic tech knowledge so I’m spending more time understanding 
some things that might be ‘common knowledge’.</ls>
         <ls>I am good at asking straight to the point questions and piecing things together to understand relationality.</ls>
</ol>

<p class="question-culture">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>

<p>Being someone who asks questions is a useful skill in overcoming learning obstacles.<p>

<p class="question-culture">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was 
resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections 
on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>

<p>I once incorrectly promoted a gig and had someone approach me who was upset that they hadn’t been mentioned in the 
event when they very much were entitled to being listed. It was a very big oversight that I was responsible for and 
took full responsibility. Even though everything had gone to print and there was nothing I could do to correct what 
had been done I communicated, apologized, took full responsibility and made sure that in the next round of prints 
they were mentions as well as across all social media promotions. Taking responsibility didn’t solve the problem but it 
eased tension. I was disappointed that when I approached my superiors they were very quick to distance themselves from any 
responsibility and prioritized vocalizing that over problem solving the issue. I think that when you’re working as a team it’s 
not always important to say who’s at fault as much as it is to find a solution and check in that everyone is feeling on the same
 page and supported. </p>
