<p class="question-culture">What are three new things you have learned about yourself 
    and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>


<p>I learnt that I was practising a growth mindset without realising it,
    that although I consider myself to be a patient person coding can make me really 
irritable and taking regular breaks was useful in managing my momentum. I also realised that meditation 
helped in managing my stress levels.</p>

 <p class="question-culture">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
<p>The more I've learnt about coding the more I've realised how much plays into webdevelopement the more I've seen how important
    it is to work with other people, have multiple brains, eyes and skills problem solving. I see that team work is a crucial part of
    programming and with that empathy for others and self awareness of how you best learn and communicate it pretty damn important. 
</p>
<p class="question-culture">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
<p>I guess I was pretty shocked that we were all asked to engage with emotional intelligence to the same degree when under the conext of structural
    oppression some of us are more likely to have higher emotional intelligence than others but I guess I shouldn't be that shocked or surprised by that.
</p>
<p class="question-culture">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they 
    might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
<p>I think that for the most part I'm pretty personable and can understand the communication techiques of many personalities. A learning obstacle
in being so emotionally sensitive is that you sometimes become the negotiator or peace keeper and spend too  much time trying to make others feel
comfortable and put your needs second, including your needs around work and learning.
</p>

<p class="question-culture">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
<p>It was hard spending time writing a blog on thigs outside of tech stuff when I was feeling time poor around learning HTML, css or javascript.
    It was difficult mentally making space for things outside of programming.
</p>
<p class="question-culture">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning 
    in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
<p>From what I know about programming spaces, they sound to be pretty hostile environments, which I think is reflected in alot of the most
    popularly used platforms. I think DEA is trying to challenge that and alter the culture of peoples engagement with tech before they enter tech 
    in the hope that it will create broader, systemic change.
</p>
<p class="question-culture">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you 
    have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>

<p>I would be lying if I said I didn't feel like the core learning was a waste of time. I understand the value of it, and I think it is valuable work, 
    but in this moment, while I frantically try to keep up with a increasing workload I FEEL like it's a waste. I think the looping excersises were good in breaking 
the awkward barrier between students and allowed me to connect in a way I wouldn't have otherwise. </p>
