    Remember HTML and CSS?
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is just text and structure. It's like when you wake up and you're all words and monotone. I mean sure, you're standing upright and we got the message that you needed coffee, but no one heard a please..
    </p>
    <p>CSS is post coffee, post shower, maybe we went for a run (but probably not). We got that gold eyeshadow on, put that pretty lil thing on we bought the other week. We're strutting down the street, feeling fucking FINE, I know it, you know it, the whole damn street can see, we got a full spectrum of colours to work with and we're WORKING IT!</p>

      Control Flow and Loops?
    </p>
    <p><b>Control flow</b> manages when instructions, function calls or statements happen. So when you're paying attention to  <b>control flow</b> in your code and giving clear instructionswhen it's making sure things happen when you want them to happen and creating order in commands. Kinda like we (generally) know to put our underwear on before our pants but computers don't wear clothes so you need to tell them very clearly what the first step is to make sure things look and happen the way you want.
    </p>
    <p><b>Loops</b> run the same code over and over and over again, each time with a different value until what they're looking to happen happens. JavaScript has a bunch of different types of <b>Looping</b> and all of them look intimidating as fuck. Here's an example of a <b>for loop</b> which we can use when we don't know the number of iterations.</p>
    <p>var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
           sum = sum + i;

    <p>What the fuck does all this mean? Let's break it down!
        So we've got the "var"(variable) which in this case has been named "sum" and has been set to "0". So the measurements of the loop will start from 0. Then we start the 'for' component of the loop, which runs all three main components of the a loop in the same line, wheras for other loops, they can be scattered throughout. This makes the 'for-loop' much more readable which makes it more easy to maintain and therefor the most popular loop to use.
        When we look at the actual "loop" part of the <b>for loop</b> we can see the three parts it's made up of, each separated by a semicolon (;). The first is called the <em>initializer</em> (var i = 1). The <em>initializer</em>, you guessed it, initializes the loop. It's used just the once to get shit running.
        The second is a <em>test condition</em>(i<=50) aka “i’s value is less than 50”. If the answer is true and what we’re measuring is smaller than 50 then the rest of the loop continues, if not and it’s false then computer’s job is done and it doesn’t bother with continuing. The third part of the <b>loop</b>(i++) is called an <em>updater</em> and generally increments (increases) or decrements (decreases) the counter.
        Then we finish it up with a lil reiteration of the command "sum = sum +i".

    <p class="question thin-maroon-border">THE DOM (not the Dominatrix you think she is but also not that different!)
    </p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and is essentially a window you can open on any website and view all the code that makes up that site. The DOM is language neutral, so you can use any programming instructions you need to alter the content, structure and style of a page. The DOM pretty much has absolute control making the World Wide Web it’s lil bitch. Through the DOM I opened up Pauline Hanson’s website and corrected a bunch of the headings to read how much of a racist piece of trash she is. Unfortunately, my laptop doesn’t have that kind of authority to the site so when I refreshed the page her disguised bigotry remained across her vapid face. It’s the small wins that carry us through..  
    The DOM is useful for altering your own site (which you would have ultimate Dominatrix authority on) and allows you to make more comprehensive alterations.
 
    <p class="question thin-maroon-border">Arrays, Objects and how to sweet talk them into giving you what you want.
    </p>An <b>array</b> is a data structure which holds a bunch of elements that hold the same kind of data. It's kind of like the glue of a coding equation and holds shit together so things can be measured and processed within context of one another.

    <p class="question thin-maroon-border"> Why fuck with Functions?
    </p>
    <p> A function in JavaScript is kinda like a class in CSS. You're able to call all the code inscribed into it by a name. This saves a bunch of time and energy, rather than righting new code out everytime you need something and doubling up you can just call the same function whenever you need the data in it. It can be given data to operate on and can also return data back to you! </p>
    
    <p>I saw a YouTube video of some coding Prodigy who was 10 years old and new 14 coding languages and was starting a masters at a University (or something like that). They compared writing code to being like writing poetry. You can write something on a page but what makes words poetry is it being concise and indepth at the same time. I think that's what functions and classes do. You say as a lot while saying little.. That shit's deep..
