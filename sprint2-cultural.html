            <p class= "question-culture">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</p>

            I want to create communication platforms to support community and culture.
            
           <p class= "question-culture"> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
            
            I would like to be more motivated for working in a team. I know that this kind of work (and most kinds of work) require many people to do the job and to do it well. I lack trust in others to follow through or be invested in making things of a high quality and standard therefore have trouble relinquishing control.

This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
           </p> 
            <p>I think it would be good practice to pursue someone else’s vision or idea first before diving straight into a leadership role.

            <p class= "question-culture">
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I will seek help from Dan and Kelly.

            <p class="question-culture">
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.
            </p>
            <p>
            My expectations of the facilitation team changes from day to day, week to week, depending on what the course load is. Is this question asking about while I'm doing foundations? Or for what I expect of the Bootcamp. This question is unclear. 
            </p>
            <p class= "question-culture">
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
            </p>
            <p>March 1st is blocked out for performance work.
