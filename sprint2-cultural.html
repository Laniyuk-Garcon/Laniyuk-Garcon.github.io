            What is your long term goal and or career pathway?

            I want to create communication platforms specifically for Indigenous People.
            
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            
            I would like to be more motivated for working in a team. I know that this kind of work (and most kinds of work) require many people to do the job and to do it well. I lack trust in others to follow through or be invested in making things of a high quality and standard therefore have trouble relinquishing control.
            
            A description of your own strengths and limitations
            Strengths
            Determined 
            ‘straight talker’
            Assertive
            Quick learner and not hesitant to ask questions.
            Good at relaying information so it’s more readily understood and accessible.
            Critical thinker
            Good at following instruction
            
            Limitations
            Can be intimidating
            Stubborn in perspective (hesitant to change original goal or vision)
            Lacking faith in others to do a job to a standard I have set for myself.
            Set very high standards and expectations of myself
            
            
            Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
            
            I think it would be good practice to pursue someone else’s vision or idea first before diving straight into a leadership role. 
            
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
            I will seek help from Dan and Kelly.
            
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.
            
            
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
            March 1st is blocked out for performance work.
            
            These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated
