        <p class="question-culture"> What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, use and manage your emotions in a positive way to relieve stess, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. It can help you with connecting with your feelings, turn your intention into action and make informed decisions about what matters the most to you.
        </p>
        <p class="question-culture">There are five categories of Emotional Intelligence</p>
        <ol>
            <ls>SELF-AWARNESS</ls>
             <p>The ability to recognize and understand your own emotions and their impact on others.
            Emotional self-awareness allows you to identify behavioural and emotional aspects of ourselves which then can be improved.</p>
            <ls>SELF-REGULATION</ls>
            <p>The ability to manage one's negative or disruptive emotions and adpat to changes in circumstances.
            Those who are skilled in self-regualtion excel in managing conflict, adapt well to change and are more likely to take responsibility.</p>
            <ls>MOTIVATION</ls>
             <p>The ability to self-motivate with a focus on achieving internal or self-gratification as opposed to external praise or reward.
            Individuals who are able to motivate themselves in this way have a tendency to be more committed and goal focused.</p>
            <ls>EMPATHY</ls>
            <p>The ability to recognise and understand how others are feeling and consider those feelings before responding in social situations.
            Empathy allows an individual to understand dynamics that influence relationships, both personal and professional.</p>
            <ls>SOCIAL SKILLS</ls>
            <p> The ability to manage the emotions of others through emotional understanding. These skills are used to build rapport and connection 
                with people through active listening as well as verbal and nonverbal communication. </p>
        </ol>     
        <p class="question-culture">Whats the difference between EQ and IQ?</p>  

        <p>EQ (Emotional Quotient) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and measurments gained through a standardized test. EQ measures someone's social and emotional competency
         and IQ someone's intellectual reasoning. Apparently EQ is acquired and can be improved where as IQ is something you're born with (not sure I believe that you're 
         IQ can't be improved or developed).</p>
       <p>A person with good EQ can recognise, control and express one's own emotions as well as perceive and assess others. A person with a high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge and 
        possess logical reasoning and abstract thinking.</p>

        <p class="question-culture">In my opinion</p>
        <p> One of the key differences between IQ and EQ is the social status and applause that you receive for them. 
            Being an emptionally intelligent person doesn't equate to an access of power or influence. If that were the case why aren't 
            there women in more high paying leadership roles? Winning Grammy's or Nobel prizes? Emotional intelligence might make you a 
            good employee but I don't think it equates to access to power. I question Dev Academys intent in preparing us for the work place. 
            As women, were are conditioned from a young age to be 'nice' and 'palatable', often  sacrificing our own wants and needs to not 
            be more unlikeable. I don't this task on emotional intelligence is particularly useful for most non-cis white men but rather is further 
            grooming us to be more receptive to the over bearing needs of our superiors. I also don't think that having a high EQ
            means that you necessarily CARE for others, but that you are able to emotionally manipulate youreself and others.</p>
